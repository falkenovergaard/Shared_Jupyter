    "## Question 1.1\n",
    "Introduced in 1950 by Richard Hamming, the Hamming code is basically a means of counteracting errors in the transfer of data in binary bit format. In the case of Hamming himself, the errors originated from the a punchcard reader at his workplace. Yet, this method can in principle be used for errorcorrection in data transfer, no matter the medium.\n",
    "The Hamming code makes use of the concepts of dot-product from linear algebra and parity bits in combination. The idea is this: take a 4-bit piece of data, you wish to transfer. This can be seen as a 4x1 vector. Multiply this vector by a 7x4 so-called _\"generator-matrix\"_, to create a 7-bit _code word_. This 7-bit code word now contains both the original 4 bits of data along with 3 parity bits, that can be used for error correction, once data has been transfered. \n",
    "The code below contains a method that, when supplied with a 4-bit data-string constructs a 7-bit code word, using a Hamming Code (named _G matrix_ in the code, short for generator matrix). The details of the method will be explained below.\n"

    "### Parity bits\n",
    "These bits do not contain parts of the original data, but rather meta data in the form of _\"data about the data\"_. This means, that a parity bit is an indication of wether the number of 1's in a piece of data is even or odd. Working with even parities, means that a parity bit will be 1, if the number of 1's in piece of data is odd, as this makes the sum of all 1's even (odd number + 1 = even number.\n",
    "In the code above, 3 parity bits are introduced in positions 1,2 and 4 of the 7-bit code word. This can be seen, as rows 1,2 and 4 in the G_matrix have 3 1' each, but in different positions. What this means is, that all the parity bits look at 3 positions in the original 4 pieces of data, and checks, whether they are even or odd. As an example, the first parity bit (first row of G-matrix) has the form __[1,0,1,1]__, which means that is \"look\" for 1's in positions 1,3,4. Our data is __[1,0,1,0]__, which means we get a dot-product of 2 in this instance, as both vectors have a 1 in positions 1 and 3. And so the parity bit in position 1 is a zero, as the number of 1's in the bits looked at is already even. In the code this check for even/oddd is done by using the _modulus-operator_ with 2 (%2).\n",
    "The following table illustrates which parity bits (P) are looking at which data bits (D), and which positions the different bits are placed in, in the final 7-bit code word:\n",

    "The 4 remaining bits of the 7-bit codeword in positions 3,5,6,7 are basically just a mirroring of the original 4 bits of data. It is worth noting (as is also illustrated in the above table), that the G-matrix used in this case actually turns the original 4 bits of data around. This can be seen by the way, that the 7th row of the G-matrix has a 1 in it's first position. This means that it \"looks\" at the first position of the data. The 6'th row has a 1 in it's 3rd position and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Encoding a 4 bits of data in to a 7 bit code word is only really a clever thing to do, if the data is at risk of incurring errors in the form of flipped bits. To demonstrate how the use of a Hamming code can effectively find and correct such a flipped bit error, the following code is a method, that introduces a random flipped bit to our code word __[0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1]__: \n"

    "The above code, location and correcting the random bit-error in principle works just like the operation of encoding the 4-bit message. The H-matrix, being a 3x7 matrix, when multiplied by our 7x1 code word vector, results in a 3x1 vector representing the results of a parity-check of the 3 parity bits in the code word. If we look at the first row of the H-matrix __[1,0,1,0,1,0,1]__, it has 1's in position 1,3,5 and 7. Position 1 is the position of the parity bit itself, and if we look back at the table above (subsection on __parity bits__), we see that the first parity bit does indeed look to the data-bits in positions 3,5,7. As the Hamming code is working with even parity bits, the dot product of looking at the 4 positions should be an even number (once again the _modulus-operator_ is used with 2 (%2) to make this check in the code). If the parity check is even, the modulus-operation will result in a 0, indicating that the sum of 1's is still even, and that no single bits have been flipped in any of the 4 positions 1,3,5,7, as the dot-product would otherwise have been odd.\n",
    "This means, that in case there are no errors in the data, the result of multiplying the H-matrix by the code word will be a [0,0,0] vector. In our case an error has been introduced, as 1 bit has been flipped. And this is where the Hamming code gets really clever. If the flipped bit is one of the parity bits, it is quite obvious, as the parity bit will now be giving the wrong information (saying even, when the number of one's being looked at is odd or the other way around). If, on the other hand, the bit-error is in a bit of the original data, all bits of data are \"covered\" by at least 2 parity bits (3 parity bits for data-bit 1). This means, that when a data-bit is flipped, 2 parity bits will actually be giving the wrong information (saying even, when the number of one's being looked at is odd or the other way around). Knowing which 2 parity bits are wrong, we also know which data-bit has been flipped, as it must be the one, shared by the 2 parity bits, that are \"lying\". This information is simply used to flip back the bit in the position corresponding position (a parity bit is 1 parity bit is wrong, and a data-bit if 2 or 3 parity-bits are wrong.\n",
    "The following code completes the last step of utilizing the Hamming code, by decoding the error corrected 7-bit code word back into the original 4-bit data-string by utilizing a _decoding matrix_ (named R_matrix in the code). The details of the code are explained below:\n"

    "### Dot product\n",
    "In text similarity the dot product is a powerful way to determine if there is any similarity between two documents. A positive dot product means that there is similarity between the documents, in  some way. However, the product itself does not give an indication in what way the documents is similar. E.g. when document A consist of same words as document B, but document A has 10x more words. In this case the theta would be 0o ( cos(0) = 1 ) but the big distances would imply a high dot product, due to a large number of the words occurrences. Therefore, when using the dot product as a similarity measure, it is important to bring in additional measures in order to establish the type of similarity.\n",

    "$$ A \\cdot B =\\| A \\| \\| B \\| cos(\\theta) $$\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "By this definition we know, that a dot product equals to zero, implies two orthogonal vectors, which means that the theta is 90 degrees. And as we know that the greater our theta is, the less the value of cosine of theta, thus the similarity decreases between two documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Euclidean distance\n",
    "The Euclidean distance tells about the length between the endpoints of the vectors, which give an indication of how long the distance between words in two documents is. It is important, to note if one term is represented many times in the document but the rest of words is similar to the searching document, the distance will go up, which could give a false indication of the similarity. Therefore when using the Euclidean measure it is important to look at the cosine similarity in order to assess if the abovementioned hypothesis is correct. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\| q - p \\| = \\sqrt{(q - p)^2 * (q - p)^2}$$\n",
    " \n",
    "### Cosine similiarity\n",
    "This brings us to using Cosine similarity as a distance measure, as the cosine similarity actually tells us how great the angle between two vectors is. We can then say how similar or far away two documents is. With a cosine of theta = 1 indicating that there is a 100% similarity between two documents. This will happen only if the exact same words occur in the different documents.  \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ cos(\\theta) = \\frac{A \\cdot B} {\\| A \\| \\| B \\|} $$\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Assessment\n",
    "On the basis of abovementioned, it is clear that various measures needs to be done in order to find an accurate similarity grade. Using Euclidean distance and cosine similarity individually, and a assessing the similarity on these measures, we find a proper indication of document similarities.  \n"
